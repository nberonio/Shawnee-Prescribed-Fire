Below is what it looks like with the SkySat image overlaid on top of the Landsat data, before the matching. Each image's histogram is shown as well:\n",

It's not important to generate that histogram with a really high fidelity, so the `maxPixels` argument is set to use less than \"4 tiles\" of data (256 \\* 256 \\* 4) and `bestEffort` is turned on, to make the computation run fast. When these arguments are set this way, the `reduceRegion()` function will try to figure out how many pixels it would need to process at the given scale, and if that's greater than the `maxPixels` value, it computes a lower scale to keep the total number of pixels below `maxPixels`.
